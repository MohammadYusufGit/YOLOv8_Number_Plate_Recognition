## YOLOv8 Number Plate Recognition
This repository contains a YOLOv8-based implementation for number plate recognition. The project is designed to train a custom YOLOv8 model on a dataset of number plates, perform inference on test images, and save the predictions.
### Features
Custom Dataset Support: Train the YOLOv8 model using a custom dataset for number plate detection.
Training Pipeline: Train the model with configurable hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, image size).
Inference: Run the trained model to detect and save predictions on new images or videos.
